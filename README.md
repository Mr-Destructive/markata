# Markata

I am still learning what this will be.  Code is completely in develop branch and likely to change significantly.

## Motivation

I want a simple static site generator built off of plugins that are super easy to create, and intuitive to use.  I want to create content in markdown and not have to put much thought into seo meta tags or generating og images.  The final site should be lightweight, and not weighed down heavily with MB's of unused css/js.

⚡ Fast enough site generation

🔌 Pluggable

🧠 Intuitive

🐍 Familiar language

🖼 OG:image out of the box

🎯 SEO out of the box
